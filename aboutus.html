                <h1>Who are we?</h1>
                <p>We are a family of gamers who value:</p>
                <ul class="valuesList">
                    <li class="values">Gaming</li>
                    <li class="values">Community</li>
                    <li class="values">Diversity</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>So what does this mean?</h1>
                <p>
                    In gaming like many other fast growing fields we Africans -especially those from Sub-Saharan Africa - are lagging begind in development and technological advancements. This is another untapped niche that could very much be profitable to us as a continent, as a people and most importantly, as a community. 
                    <br>
                    Wells and I just learned that the Olympics are considering adding an <strong>eSports division</strong>. Can you imagine that? 
                    <br> 
                    No you can't. 
                    <br>
                    Let me help you build that picture.
                    <br>
                    Just like our prospects, the picture starts small.
                    <br>
                    <em>Click on it to see what happens</em>
                </p>
                <img src="resources/Esports_6.1.jpg" alt="E-sports_Meet" class="small" id="smart_thumbnail">
                <p id="onImgClick"></p>
                <p>
                    There will be qualifiers and preliminaries for getting to the Olympics, but instead of field and track, we are looking at eSports teams holding their console pads and headphones. 
                    <br>
                    <strong>Yes!</strong>
                    <br>
                    Does this exhilerate you?
                    <br>                                
                    If it does, I don't think there is a better sign you need to join us. That is just a fraction of what I am talking about.
                    <br>
                    We, want to build a strong African appearance at such like events, we already have seen that there is a cake, but we shall not wait any longer to be invited to the table, we want to cut us a slice.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>
                        Do you want a piece of this slice?
                        Do you want in?
                        I know I do.
                    </strong> 
                    </p>

                    <h2>So what next?</h2> 
                    <p>
                    We want to know that there are people that really want this almost as much as we do. Then we start. We create teams - Fifa, GTA, Call of Duty, Fortnight, League of Legends, Tekken. 
                    <br> <br>
                    Not a big fan of console gaming?
                    You can use a Personal Computer
                    Or your mobile phone. 
                    <br> <br>
                    Yes, this is what we are doing.
                    It means that we are buliding a community of diverse gamers that are passionate about the art - the art of gaming.  
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                    We believe you have what it takes. We would love you to join us.
                    Nothing makes me as proud as hearing African anthems with African flags flying up high in international athletic meets. How much more desire do I have for such accomplishments to happen in eSports competitions.
                    <br>
                    We at Level G are committing ourselves to build a community of gamers across the planet to make more of this hobby.
